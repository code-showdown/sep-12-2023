let's review each other code!

- Everyone can create a folder and put the code that you're not sure about.
- Submit, then wait for other people to improve it, **or you can improve other people's code**.

to do so,

- Fork/clone this repo.
- Create a new folder to put your code (if you want to ask), or modify someone's code (if you want to review).
- Make a pull request.

## Rules

- The improvements should be constructive, positive, and respectful. You can improve it in any way you like: make it faster, more readable, fix bugs, add documentation, coding convention style, etc.
